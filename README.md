# Awesome Internet Computer

This is a directory of all identifiable projects in the Internet Computer ecosystem globally. Its V1.0 was previously hosted on [Github Page](https://zire.github.io/awesome-IC/). Its V2.0 has recently been migrated to Internet Computer - ie. using IC as its backend. 

For Github Page-based V1.0, the deployment workflow goes like:

- Make changes in local machine to `README.md` via `Macdown`, a Markdown editor
- Git all/commit/push
- [Awesome IC](https://zire.github.io/awesome-IC/) will be automatically updated

This workflow ensures version control and what's rendered on Github Page is consistent with the Markdown file.

For IC-based V2.0, the deployment workflow is now:

- Make changes in the local machine via DFN SDK
- Deploy to the canister and the IC website will be updated
- Git all/commit/push to Github repo to back up the code

This workflow loses the link from Github repo to IC site. The consistency between IC site and Github repo is ensured manually, rather by code. It's not perfect, but a small trade-off to bring this useful website to Internet Computer, where it truly belongs.
